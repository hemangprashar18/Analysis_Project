Agenda -: 
-> What end to end data science work look like ?
Steps-:
1) Data Collection (lets say some data coming from dbms,xlsx file etc) {Raw Data}
2) Data Cleaning {issues with row data -> Mising some colomns some data , duplicate data , formatting}
3) EDA (Exploratory data analysis) {Type - Release date , director,cast,revenue,budget,genre  -> So to see what type of movies is actually doing great}
4) Building ML MOdel (will treat it as a Black Box for now)
All of these steps are carried out in a Jupyter Notebook

Today we will make a service/tool that can help us package our data science work

( Python libraries are #rs party code packages )
if we want to pivot data i.e row becomes col and vice versa

Pandas library is required for data scienctist
It is an open source library

Streamlit library -: dashboard isse bnaenge (allows us to create without html and CSS)

then start application app.py and try to print the title 

Display data -> coming from yfinance -> stock price data

-> Where does Streamlit comes into picture ?

-> What is Streamlit , How to use this tool to build interactive dashboard

-> How to package your Machine Learning MOdel into a link which everyone can interact with without any frontend knowledge


--> Stock Price Analyser 
    In Streamlit-:
    st.write("#")
    (# means heading 1)

    Command to run -: streamlit run app.py

    We pull in stock price data using yfinance (another library) -> pip install yfinance
    ticker is basically a symbol -: 1st day , 2nd day , etc...


For deploying to streamlit community cloud -:
    First create git hub repository
    then click on New app
    then fill info and deploy
